# Artist Statement

For this project I wanted to create a game I could continue to expand on after the completion of the class as well as one that combined all I had learned so far, something to represent my knowledge concerning java now and in the future.

Though I initially intended for the game to be a bit longer and have more then one enemy type (in my proposal I had mentioned bears and deers which would act as obstacles in the user’s path that they would need to avoid but would all operate in different ways, with bears slowly following the player and deers moving in large packs with only a singular path to cut through), the base idea is pretty much what I wanted, that being a game that lightly discusses the development of civilization and its impact on mother nature as well as one with an arguably addictive repetitiveness.

Despite the fact that the game is not exactly “deep” in an emotional or thought provoking sense, I wanted my user(s) to grasp an understanding of humanity vs nature while still having fun (up until they realize the ramification of their actions, these actions being the destruction of forests via cutting the trees at each level).

I personally believe I accomplished my goals as I have grown fond of the game and enjoy the process of going through it, unlike in my other works in which I made “cheat codes” for everything to “cut to the chase” (though there are cheat codes in this work as well).

One significant change I intend on making eventually, is randomizing the position of trees and the enemies to make the levels (which I will add more of) feel more “alive” and actual sections of a deep forest (of course this will come after designing and coding the two other enemy types).

Lastly I would also like to add more tree types that offer up more or less gold (depending on their type/rarity),maybe even character customization as well as cleaned up tutorial states/opening story, and organize my code better through the use of arrays (something which I was uncomfortable enough with to avoid using in hopes of also avoiding not having to submit/something that was riddled with faults).
